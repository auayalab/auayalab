## Hi there 👋

I'm Alan, a software engineer from México.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have several installs.

Outside of work, I am interested in following advances in science. I'm also a DJ, I make music for fun and sometimes I create things with my 3D printer. ⚙️

Let's connect!
